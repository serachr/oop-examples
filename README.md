OOP examples in Java

## Extend existing code
Try to extend the examples in the following way.

### package ex01
Users can now participate in a loyalty program, where they are allowed to collect points. 
For each 100 points, a user gains 1% discount on the price of a product. The maximum discount cannot be greater than 7%.
Update existing source code to deal with this new requirement.
Update the main method to demonstrate the new behavior.

### package ex02
Revisit the main method in order to properly deal with possible exceptions.

### package ex04
Update the DrawingMain method to  print the aligned lines.
Find and fix any bugs, if any.

## Implement new code 

### Introduce package ex05
Create a new package ex05 that revisits the Drawing functionality to support Lines, Arrows and Shapes in a uniform manner. 
The new Drawing should allow users to both select and deselect its elements and also clean up the selection.
Finally, the new Drawing should be Iterable (that is, provide an iterator for all its elements).
